    <h1>From Gravel to Stream: The Salmon Life Cycle</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>The Beginning: Spawning and Incubation</h2>
    <p>
      The life of a salmon begins in the clean, <strong>oxygen-rich</strong> gravel of a freshwater 
      stream. Female salmon create a nest, or <dfn>redd</dfn>, where they deposit their eggs. 
      Once fertilized, the eggs remain tucked in the rocks through the winter. During this 
      stage, the developing embryos are <em>highly sensitive</em> to changes in water 
      temperature and silt levels.  
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "The salmon's journey is one of the most remarkable migrations in the natural world, 
        symbolizing endurance and the cycle of life."
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Growth and Metamorphosis</h2>
    <p>
        When the eggs hatch, the tiny fish are called <sub>alevin</sub>. They carry a 
        yolk sac on their bellies that provides all the nutrition they need for several 
        weeks. As they grow, they become <mark>fry</mark>, eventually developing vertical 
        stripes for camouflage.
        </p>
    <p>
        The scientific name for the Atlantic Salmon is <i>Salmo salar</i>. In some species, 
        the fish will spend their entire lives in <b>freshwater</b> lakes rather than 
        migrating to the sea.
        </p>
    
    <h2>The Final Migration</h2>
    <p>
        According to the <abbr title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration">NOAA</abbr>, 
        adult salmon use their powerful sense of smell to return to the exact spot where they were 
        born. 
        </p>
    <p>
        To reach these spawning grounds, they must leap over waterfalls. During this 
        <strong>exhausting</strong> trek, a salmon can jump up to <sup>2</sup> meters in the air. 
        This journey is often the <br> final act of their lives &mdash; a process described 
        by <cite>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</cite> as semelparous.
